# Earthquake_Challenge

## Project Overview
### Purpose of the project is to find and collect earthquake data from GeoJSON from an API (USGS), and with this data, create maps of earthquakes from around the world in an interactive web portal. The data will be shown on maps in relation to the location of the tectonic plates and the magnitude of the event.

## Steps Done
### Created mapbox account in order to create API access key, added a config file and implemented this into the index.html.
### Interactive maps come in three views: streets, satellite, and a dark mode.
